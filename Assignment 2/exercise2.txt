Exercise 2:
One of the main differences between data type int and data type Integer is the fact that 
an int is a primitive data type, while integer is a class data type. The advantage of using an int data type
over an Integer data type is that using an int is faster while an Integer is a bit slower 
because Integer requires a package declaration. While they can both store data, Integer also helps to 
convert the int into an object, while int just stores the data. Integer types are also more flexible in storing 
int data types rather than int types. An int is also 32 bits, while an Integer is 128 bits. 
Integer is also able to be converted to many different base values such as Binary, hexadecimal, etc. 
Overall, there are many differences between the two, but the main differences are the int is a primitive data type 
and is a little faster, while Integer is a class type, but is more flexible, bigger, and is better at storing data.
Integers also have more functions than ints.
