Major: Computer Science
Preferred email: jason@jbear.org
I am an undergraduate.
I am not a graduating senior
This is my first time taking this class
This is my first year at SJSU, so I have not completed any CS courses here.
Additional information: I am a Star Wars nerd, so if you want to talk Star Wars, I'd be more than happy to. I ran Track in high school and ran a mile at 5:00. 
I am a transfer student from De Anza, and I graduated from Cupertino High School in 2018.
There aren't any specific topics that I would like you to go over, so I'm down for anything.
