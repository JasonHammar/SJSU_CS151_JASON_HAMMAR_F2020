I am an undergraduate.
Are you a graduating senior?
I am not a graduating senior
Are you repeating the class?
No. This is my first time taking this class
List other CS courses you’ve completed so far at SJSU
This is my first year at SJSU, so I have not completed any CS courses here.
Any additional information you would like me to know about you?
Additional information: I am a Star Wars nerd, so if you want to talk Star Wars, I'd be more than happy to. I ran Track in high school and ran a mile at 5:00. 
I am a transfer student from De Anza, and I graduated from Cupertino High School in 2018.
If we get the time during this semester I’d like to cover some special topics. Are there any specific topics you are interested in? 
There aren't any specific topics that I would like you to go over, so I'm down for anything.
